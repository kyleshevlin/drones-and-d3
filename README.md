# Drones and D3
_and Ember_

I wanted to make a small Ember application that incorporated the [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) library. After coming across [Dronestre.am](http://dronestre.am/) API, I decided to make the visual about drone strikes done by the United States. This is not really a political statement, though perhaps seeing how many strikes have taken place may have some influence on you one way or another. Either way, it makes for an interesting visual.

To see the application, clone/fork the repository and get it up and running locally. I will leave the Ember CLI created instructions below for the time being to help you do that.

A demo of the app will be made in the near future.
